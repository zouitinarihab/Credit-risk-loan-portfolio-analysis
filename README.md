# Credit Risk & Loan Portfolio Analysis (Lending Club)

This project presents an end-to-end credit risk analysis built using Lending Club loan data.
The objective is to predict loan default risk, simulate an approval policy, and evaluate its
impact on portfolio risk, exposure, and risk–return trade-offs.
