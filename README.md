# Credit Risk & Loan Portfolio Analysis (Lending Club)

1. Project Overview:
   
This project presents an end-to-end credit risk analysis built using Lending Club loan data.
The objective is to predict loan default risk, simulate an approval policy, and evaluate its
impact on portfolio risk, exposure, and risk–return trade-offs.

3. Business Problem:
   
Financial institutions must balance credit growth with risk control.
This project addresses the following questions:

- How risky is the loan portfolio?
- Can a risk-based approval policy reduce default rates?
- How does risk concentration change after policy application?
- Where is the financial exposure concentrated?
- Are higher-risk loans sufficiently compensated by higher returns?

3. Methodology:

- Data preparation and feature engineering in Python
- Logistic Regression model for credit risk prediction
- Risk score creation and approval threshold simulation
- Portfolio impact analysis
- Interactive Power BI dashboard for decision-making

4. Key Results:

- Portfolio default rate: 19.6%
- Approval policy reduced default risk by 62%
- Approved loans show a default rate of 14% vs 37% for rejected loans
- High-risk loans represent a significant share of financial exposure

5. Tools & Technologies:

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Power BI (DAX, Power Query)
- SQL (for data reasoning)
- Git & GitHub
